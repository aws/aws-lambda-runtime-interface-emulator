# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests
This repository contains the source code and examples for the Runtime Interface Emulator. We will accept pull requests on documentation, examples, bug fixes and the Dockerfiles. We will also accept pull requests, issues and feedback on improvements to the Runtime Interface Emulator. However, our priority will be to maintain fidelity with AWS Lambdaâ€™s Runtime Interface on the cloud.

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass through `make integ-tests-and-compile`
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## How to Run Locally
1. [Install go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. Build
```bash
make compile-lambda-linux # Outputs binary to ./bin/aws-lambda-rie-x86_64
```
3. [Create an alternative base image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#images-create-from-alt)
4. [Build RIE into this alternative base image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-test.html#images-test-alternative)
- ./app/app.py
```python
import typing

def handler(event: typing.Any, context: typing.Any):
  print("Received event:", event, "content:", context)
  return "Test Complete"
```
- ./Dockerfile
```
# Define function directory
ARG FUNCTION_DIR="/function"

FROM python:buster as build-image

# Install aws-lambda-cpp build dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
  apt-get install -y \
  g++ \
  make \
  cmake \
  unzip \
  libcurl4-openssl-dev

# Include global arg in this stage of the build
ARG FUNCTION_DIR
# Create function directory
RUN mkdir -p ${FUNCTION_DIR}

# Copy function code
COPY app/* ${FUNCTION_DIR}

# Install the runtime interface client
RUN pip install \
        --target ${FUNCTION_DIR} \
        awslambdaric

# Multi-stage build: grab a fresh copy of the base image
FROM python:buster

# Include global arg in this stage of the build
ARG FUNCTION_DIR
# Set working directory to function root directory
WORKDIR ${FUNCTION_DIR}

# Copy in the build image dependencies
COPY --from=build-image ${FUNCTION_DIR} ${FUNCTION_DIR}

COPY ./entry_script.sh /entry_script.sh
ADD bin/aws-lambda-rie-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/aws-lambda-rie
ENTRYPOINT [ "/entry_script.sh" ]

CMD [ "app.handler" ]
```
- ./entry_script.sh
```bash
#!/bin/sh
if [ -z "${AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API}" ]; then
  exec /usr/local/bin/aws-lambda-rie /usr/local/bin/python -m awslambdaric $@
else
  exec /usr/local/bin/python -m awslambdaric $@
fi
```
5. Build and run the image
```bash
docker build -t hello-world
docker run -p 9000:8080 hello-world
```
6. Send a test request and see that your changes are hit
```bash
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{}'
```

## Finding contributions to work on
Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.
